# Hello-world
nothing to see here




the winner takes all, its the thrill of one more kill
the last one to fall will never sacrifice their will
don't ever look back on the world closing in
be on the attack with your wings oh let the ganes begin
and its sweet sweet sweet victory yeah and its ours for the taking
its ours for the fight and its sweet sweet sweet victory yeah
you don't win no silver oh you only lose the gold 
you push with a fever as the time keeps rolling on
against all the odds against all the pain your backs on the wall 
with knowone to blame wild hearts won't be tamed
and its sweet sweet sweet victory yeah
and its ours for the taking its ours for the fight
and its sweet sweet sweet victory yeah
and the world is ours to fall the winner takees all alll all allll alll
